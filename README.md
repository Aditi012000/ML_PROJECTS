# ML PROJECTS
This is a consolidation of all of my ML and AI exploration and projects. It covers various topics such as classification, regression, Deep Learning, NLP etc.
This is not done at a professional level, so some details that explain the projects may be missing. But the notebooks themselves should be fairly explanatory.
